# Numerical_Analysis
This file will contain assignments and projects from MATH 471 (Introduction to Numerical Analysis) at The University of Michigan, as well as other interesting things I created. The assignment descriptions are not available, but there should be ample information in the title and comments to see what was being done. These are mostly a future reference for myself.
All projects were completed in Python.
